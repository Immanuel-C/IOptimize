## How to Build 

### **IOptimize is Windows only! Only building on Visual Studio 2022 has been tested!**

To build IOptimize you need a compiler that supports C17, .Net Framework V4.7.2 and a WPF editor. A standard below both C17 and the .Net Framework V4.7.2 may work but has not been tested. 

You will also need to install premake5 for the build system. Use premake5 to build to generate to whatever editor/compiler you would like to use.
